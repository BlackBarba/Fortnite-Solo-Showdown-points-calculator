# Fortnite Solo Showdown points calculator

This is a simple points calculator for Solo Showdown mode.

You can access it here: https://blackbarba.github.io/Fortnite-Solo-Showdown-points-calculator/

It does not get the info from your Epic's account, so you must manually add your place and number of eliminations from each match in the application.

The calculations are based on the [offical rules](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/solo-showdown-official-contest-rules-july) of Solo Showdown.

The data is only saved in the local storage of your browser, but you can export a json file with all the data, and import it later in other browser/computer.
